# Argonian Anatomy

This mod introduces a new anatomy for Argonians, clearly distinguishing them from the Khajiit. The changes in proportions are achieved by implementing a custom skeleton (animation file), which replaces the skeleton for both NPCs and the player. The animation file can be easily toggled on or off via MCM. This mod is compatible with any other Argonian mods.

If you are on OpenMW and are using [Dynamic Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/57633) by Taitechnic then you don't need this mod.
